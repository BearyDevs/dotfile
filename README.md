# BearyDevs Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This is where I store all my carefully curated configuration files that I use to set up and maintain my development environment across multiple machines. Each file and folder here is the result of continuous refinement, aiming to make my workflow as efficient and enjoyable as possible.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **.config/**: Contains various configuration files for different applications.
- **Alacritty/**: My terminal emulator configuration, optimized for speed and usability.
- **Neovim/**: My Neovim setup, packed with custom key mappings, plugins, and settings.
- **Zshrc**: My Zsh configuration, tailored with aliases, functions, and themes for an enhanced shell experience.
- **Tmux.conf**: Configurations for tmux, making terminal multiplexing a breeze.
